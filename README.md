Netflix-Inspired Landing Page – HTML & CSS Project

This project is a fully responsive Netflix-inspired landing page created using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the design aesthetics and core structure of Netflix’s homepage while providing a simplified and clean user interface suitable for beginners and frontend practice.

The landing page includes a visually engaging hero section with a dark background overlay, eye-catching headings, a call-to-action input for email sign-up, and styled buttons. It introduces Netflix’s primary offerings like unlimited movies, TV shows, and the flexibility to cancel anytime.

Following the hero section, the website is divided into informative content sections:

Watch on Any Device: Demonstrates platform compatibility with smart TVs, gaming consoles, and more, accompanied by a custom image.

Download Your Shows: A section with a background video showcasing offline viewing benefits.

Create Profiles for Kids: Highlights family-friendly content through themed imagery and informative text.

The design features a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section using expandable boxes styled with SVG plus icons to mimic Netflix’s real design pattern. Although the questions are static, the layout is structured for future JavaScript interactivity if needed.

The footer includes multiple columns with links to Netflix resources such as Help Center, Jobs, Terms of Use, and more. This section is styled using grid layout and adapts gracefully to smaller screens, ensuring good mobile responsiveness.

Styling is done with custom CSS, using Google Fonts for typography and media queries for responsive design. Effects like shadows, button hover states, and layout flexibility are included to provide a modern and professional feel.

This project is an excellent example of frontend web design using pure HTML and CSS. It does not require any backend or JavaScript, making it perfect for learners who are building their foundation in web development or those who want to showcase static UI/UX skills in a portfolio.
